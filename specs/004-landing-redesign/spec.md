## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Hero Carousel with Large Visual Impact (Priority: P1)

Users visiting the landing page immediately see a prominent full-width hero carousel showcasing featured events with large imagery, clear call-to-action buttons, and automatic rotation.

**Why this priority**: The hero carousel is the first thing users see and sets the tone for the entire site. It must grab attention and drive engagement immediately.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by loading the landing page and observing the hero carousel displays correctly with auto-rotation, manual navigation arrows, and clickable event cards that link to event details.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a user visits the landing page, **When** the page loads, **Then** the hero carousel displays prominently at the top with a large featured event image, title overlay, and call-to-action button
2. **Given** the hero carousel is visible, **When** 5 seconds pass, **Then** the carousel automatically transitions to the next featured event
3. **Given** the hero carousel displays, **When** the user clicks the left/right navigation arrows, **Then** the carousel slides to the previous/next event respectively
4. **Given** the user sees a featured event in the carousel, **When** they click the call-to-action button or anywhere on the carousel item, **Then** they navigate to that event's detail page
5. **Given** multiple featured events exist, **When** the carousel reaches the last event and auto-advances, **Then** it cycles back to the first event seamlessly

### User Story 2 - Upcoming Shows Grid Display (Priority: P1)

Users can browse upcoming events in a clean grid layout below the hero, with each event shown as a card containing an image, title, date, and venue information.

**Why this priority**: This is the primary way users discover available events. The grid layout provides quick scanning and comparison of multiple events at once.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by scrolling below the hero carousel and verifying that upcoming events display in a grid with 4 columns on desktop, showing event images, titles, dates, and venue names.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** upcoming events exist, **When** the user scrolls below the hero carousel, **Then** they see a section titled "UPCOMING SHOWS" with events displayed in a grid
2. **Given** the upcoming shows grid displays, **When** viewed on desktop, **Then** events appear in rows of 4 cards
3. **Given** an event card is visible, **When** the user views it, **Then** it shows the event image, title, date, and venue name
4. **Given** an event card displays, **When** the user clicks anywhere on the card, **Then** they navigate to that event's detail page
5. **Given** no upcoming events exist, **When** the user views the upcoming shows section, **Then** they see an appropriate empty state message

---

### User Story 3 - Interactive Show Calendar (Priority: P2)

Users can browse events by date through an interactive calendar view that displays all scheduled shows organized chronologically by month.

**Why this priority**: Provides an alternative browsing method for users who prefer date-based event discovery, complementing the grid view.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by scrolling to the calendar section and verifying that events are listed chronologically with month groupings and date labels.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** scheduled events exist, **When** the user scrolls to the calendar section, **Then** they see a section titled "SHOW CALENDAR" with a search bar and date-organized event listings
2. **Given** the calendar displays, **When** viewing events, **Then** events are grouped by month (e.g., "November 2025", "December 2025")
3. **Given** a user enters text in the calendar search bar, **When** they type, **Then** the event listings filter in real-time to show only events matching the search term in title, venue, or description
4. **Given** a month grouping is visible, **When** viewing events within that month, **Then** each event shows the date, day of week, event title, venue, and a ticket button
5. **Given** an event listing displays, **When** the user clicks the "Find Tickets" button, **Then** they navigate to the event registration or detail page
6. **Given** multiple months have events, **When** the user views the calendar, **Then** the current month appears first, followed by future months in chronological order

### User Story 4 - Past Concerts Archive Gallery (Priority: P3)

Users can explore past concerts and events through a visual gallery section showcasing artist/band images with names, providing a sense of venue history and credibility.

**Why this priority**: Adds social proof and content richness but is not critical for core event discovery and booking functionality.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by scrolling to the bottom and verifying that past concert images display in a grid with artist/band names.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** past events exist, **When** the user scrolls to the bottom of the page, **Then** they see a section titled "PAST CONCERTS" with a grid of 8-12 artist/event images
2. **Given** the past concerts grid displays, **When** viewed on desktop, **Then** images appear in rows of 4
3. **Given** an artist/event image displays, **When** the user views it, **Then** the artist or band name appears overlaid or below the image
4. **Given** a past concert image is visible, **When** the user clicks it, **Then** they navigate to a detail page or archive view for that artist/event
5. **Given** more than 8-12 past events exist, **When** the user views the past concerts section, **Then** they see a "View More" link to access additional past events
6. **Given** no past events exist, **When** the user views the page, **Then** the past concerts section is hidden

### User Story 5 - Responsive Mobile Layout (Priority: P1)

Mobile users experience an optimized layout where the hero carousel, event grid, and all sections adapt seamlessly to smaller screen sizes.

**Why this priority**: Mobile traffic is critical for modern web applications; responsive design is a must-have, not a nice-to-have.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by resizing the browser to mobile viewport (375px width) and verifying that all sections stack vertically with single-column layouts and touch-friendly controls.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a mobile user visits the landing page, **When** the page loads, **Then** the hero carousel fills the viewport width with appropriately sized touch targets for navigation
2. **Given** the user views the upcoming shows section on mobile, **When** the grid displays, **Then** event cards appear in a single column
3. **Given** the user views the calendar on mobile, **When** the listings display, **Then** date labels and event information remain readable without horizontal scrolling
4. **Given** the user views any section on tablet (768px), **When** the layout renders, **Then** the grid displays 2 columns
5. **Given** the user interacts with any clickable element on mobile, **When** they tap it, **Then** the touch target is sufficiently large (minimum 44x44px) for easy interaction

### Edge Cases

- What happens when there are no upcoming events? → Display empty state with message and link to view all events
- What happens when there is only one event in the hero carousel? → Disable auto-rotation and hide navigation arrows
- What happens when an event image fails to load? → Display a fallback placeholder image
- What happens when there are many upcoming events? → Display all events with pagination controls (e.g., "Load More" button or page numbers)
- What happens when an event date passes while the page is open? → The event remains visible until page refresh (real-time updates not required)
- What happens on very large screens (>1920px)? → Content container has a maximum width with centered alignment
- What happens when JavaScript is disabled? → Static first event from hero displays, grid shows all events

- Current carousel implementation can be extended or replaced to match the hero carousel design in the screenshot
- Event images are provided at sufficient resolution for large hero display (minimum 1920x1080px recommended)

## Dependencies

## Notes

The redesign focuses on creating a visually rich landing page that emphasizes discovery through multiple browsing methods: hero carousel for immediate attention, grid for quick scanning, calendar for date-based browsing, and archive for social proof. The layout follows modern event/concert website patterns with heavy use of imagery and clear calls-to-action.
