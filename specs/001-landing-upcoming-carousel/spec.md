# Feature Specification: Landing Upcoming Events Carousel

**Feature Branch**: `001-landing-upcoming-carousel`  
**Created**: 2025-10-26  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Change upcoming event in landing page section to an image carousel displaying all events that have not started. The carousel will auto move to next item every 5 seconds, include a fade transition when items change, and users can go to the event detail page by clicking the event."

## User Scenarios & Testing (mandatory)

### User Story 1 - See upcoming events at a glance (Priority: P1)

As a visitor on the landing page, I want to see a rotating carousel of upcoming events (not started yet) so that I can quickly discover what’s next.

**Why this priority**: This is the primary discovery surface for events on the landing page.

**Independent Test**: Load the landing page with at least 3 future events; verify a carousel renders only upcoming events and cycles automatically.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. Given there are multiple upcoming events, When I load the landing page, Then I see a carousel with event images and titles sourced only from future-starting events.
2. Given the carousel is visible, When 5 seconds elapse, Then it advances to the next event automatically.
3. Given a user prefers to wait, When no interaction occurs, Then the carousel continues to cycle through all upcoming events in order and loops.

### User Story 2 - Smooth transitions (Priority: P2)

As a visitor, I want a smooth fade transition between carousel items so the change isn’t jarring.

**Why this priority**: Improves perceived quality and readability.

**Independent Test**: Observe a transition; verify a fade animation is used and completes within a reasonable time.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. Given the carousel is cycling, When it switches items, Then the outgoing item fades out and the next item fades in within ~300–500ms.
2. Given accessibility needs, When animation is disabled at system level, Then the experience remains usable (no hard dependency on animation to understand content).

### User Story 3 - Navigate to event details (Priority: P3)

As a visitor, I want to click an item in the carousel to open the event’s detail page so I can learn more and register.

**Why this priority**: Enables conversion from discovery to consideration/registration.

**Independent Test**: Click any visible carousel image/title; verify navigation lands on the corresponding event’s detail page.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. Given a carousel item is visible, When I click the item (image or title), Then I navigate to the correct event detail page.
2. Given keyboard users, When I focus the current item and press Enter, Then it navigates to the same destination.

### Edge Cases

- No upcoming events exist: the carousel does not render and the section is hidden or replaced with a friendly “No upcoming events” message.
- Exactly one upcoming event: carousel renders a single item without auto-advancing (no animation required) or cycles the same item without visual disruption.
- Very long event titles/descriptions: text truncates or wraps without breaking layout.
- Missing images: a safe placeholder image or background displays; the item still links.
- Time zone differences/clock skew: upcoming is determined consistently using a single reference (assumption below).

## Requirements (mandatory)

### Functional Requirements

- FR-001: Only events with a start time strictly in the future are included in the landing carousel.
- FR-002: Carousel auto-advances to the next item every 5 seconds (5,000ms) when there are 2 or more items.
- FR-003: A fade transition is applied when changing items; the transition completes within 300–500ms.
- FR-004: Each carousel item is clickable (image and title) and navigates to the corresponding event detail page.
- FR-005: If there are no upcoming events, the carousel section is not displayed (or a friendly message is shown).
- FR-006: If only one upcoming event exists, the carousel does not auto-advance (no perceptible flicker/loop).
- FR-007: Items are ordered by soonest start time first.
- FR-008: The carousel is keyboard accessible: the visible item is focusable and Enter activates navigation.
- FR-009: Provide basic resilience to missing images by showing a placeholder while still allowing navigation.

### Key Entities (data involved)

- Event (read-only for this feature): id, title, slug, image, start time, end time, tags. Used to filter “upcoming,” display image/title, and construct the detail link.

## Success Criteria (mandatory)

### Measurable Outcomes

- SC-001: On the landing page, upcoming-only events are shown with 0% inclusion of already-started events across 50+ test loads.
- SC-002: Auto-advance occurs every 5s ± 0.5s during a 60s observation window without user interaction.
- SC-003: Fade transitions complete within 0.5s in 95% of cycles under typical network/device conditions.
- SC-004: 100% of visible carousel items navigate to the correct event detail page when clicked.
- SC-005: With zero upcoming events, no empty carousel is shown; users instead see no section or a friendly message.

## Assumptions

- "Upcoming" is determined using the user’s current time compared against event start time.
- All events have an image; if not, a neutral placeholder can be used for visual consistency.
- The landing page already has a section designated for "upcoming events" that will be replaced by the carousel.

## Dependencies & Risks

- Depends on availability of event data including start times and slugs/ids for routing.
- Risk of time zone inconsistencies mitigated by consistent comparison against a single time source.

## Out of Scope

- Manual carousel controls (previous/next, indicators) unless added later.
- Swipe gestures on touch devices (can be considered as a follow-up enhancement).
- Server-side personalization or A/B testing of carousel content.
