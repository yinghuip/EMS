# Feature Specification: Event listing page

**Feature Branch**: `001-add-event-listing`  
**Created**: 2025-10-26  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "build an event listing page to list out all event in chronological order. user can access the listing page by clicking events in nav bar"

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Browse events (Priority: P1)

As a visitor, I want to view a list of events in chronological order so I can discover upcoming or past events and decide which to learn more about or attend.

**Why this priority**: This is the core user value — without a browsable list users cannot discover events.

**Independent Test**: Navigate to the Events page from the site navigation and confirm events are rendered in chronological order and are tappable/clickable.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** the user is on any page, **When** they click the "Events" item in the site nav, **Then** they see the Events listing page with events shown in chronological order and the page header identifies it as "Events".
2. **Given** the listing contains more than the initial page size, **When** the user scrolls to the end, **Then** the next page of events loads (or a "Load more" control appears) and preserves chronological order.
3. **Given** an event appears in the list, **When** the user clicks/taps the event card, **Then** they are taken to the event detail page for that event.

4. **Given** the listing is longer than a single page, **When** the user reaches the end of the visible list, **Then** a "Load more" control is visible and can be used to load the next batch of events. The control must be keyboard-focusable and screen-reader labelled.

5. **Given** the user wants to see past events, **When** they enable the "Include past events" filter, **Then** the list updates to include past events in the same chronological order and the UI clearly distinguishes past vs upcoming events.

6. **Given** the user wants a different ordering, **When** they change the sort from the default, **Then** the list reorders accordingly and the chosen sort option is persisted for the session (or remembered if user preference persistence is available).

### User Story 2 - Quick glance details (Priority: P2)

As a user scanning the list, I want to see essential event metadata (date/time, title, short description, location), so I can quickly decide which events to open.

**Why this priority**: Improves discovery and lowers friction to the detail/registration flow.

**Independent Test**: Confirm each visible event card displays date/time, title, short description (<= 150 chars), and location.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** an event has a title, date, and location, **When** it is shown on the listing, **Then** those fields are visible and readable on small and large viewports.

### User Story 3 - Empty and error states (Priority: P3)

As a user, if there are no events or the events cannot be loaded, I should see a clear message and a suggested next step.

**Why this priority**: Ensures graceful experience when data is absent or backend is unreachable.

**Independent Test**: Simulate no-events and network/error state and verify shown messaging and CTA (e.g., "No upcoming events" and a link to contact or refresh).

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** there are no events, **When** the Events page is opened, **Then** the page displays a friendly no-events message and suggests alternatives (e.g., check back later, subscribe to notifications).
2. **Given** the event list cannot be loaded, **When** the Events page is opened, **Then** the page displays an error state with an option to retry.

---

### Edge Cases

- What happens when two events have the same start date/time? (Tiebreaker rule: stable secondary sort by title.)
- Events with missing fields (no location, no short description): show placeholder text such as "Location TBD" or omit gracefully.
- Very long lists: ensure pagination or lazy-loading prevents large initial payloads.
- Accessibility: ensure keyboard navigation and screen reader labels exist for each interactive element.

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: The application MUST expose an Events listing page reachable from the main navigation labeled "Events".
- **FR-002**: The Events listing page MUST display events in chronological order.
- **FR-003**: Each event entry in the list MUST show: title, start date/time, short description (if available), and location (if available).
- **FR-004**: Each event entry MUST be clickable/tappable and navigate to the event detail page.
- **FR-005**: The listing MUST support pagination or progressive loading for large event sets (see [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: pagination vs infinite scroll preference]).
# **FR-005**: The listing MUST support pagination or progressive loading for large event sets. The default UX is a paginated/"Load more" control (explicit pagination or a Load more button) to preserve accessibility, bookmarking, and predictable performance.
- **FR-006**: The listing MUST have a clear empty state and an error state with retry.
- **FR-007**: The listing and controls MUST be responsive and accessible (keyboard and screen reader friendly).
- **FR-008**: The listing MUST be testable via automated UI tests (selectors and semantic labels present).

*Example of marking unclear requirements:*

- **FR-009**: The listing MUST include past events [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: should past events be shown or only upcoming events?]
- **FR-010**: Chronological order definition [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: should chronological be oldest-to-newest or newest/upcoming-first?]
 - **FR-009**: The listing MUST show upcoming events by default and provide an explicit control (filter/toggle) to include past events in the listing. The user's preference may be remembered per session.
 - **FR-010**: The listing MUST default to newest/upcoming-first (soonest events at the top). The UI MUST expose a sort control allowing the user to switch order (e.g., oldest→newest) and remember that preference where feasible.

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*

- **Event**: Represents a single event. Key attributes (business-facing):
  - id (unique identifier)
  - title
  - startDateTime
  - endDateTime (optional)
  - shortDescription
  - location (name or virtual)
  - imageUrl (optional)
  - registrationRequired (boolean)
  - status (draft, published, cancelled)

## Success Criteria *(mandatory)*

### Measurable Outcomes

- **SC-001**: Users can reach the Events listing page from the main navigation in 1 click from any page (100% availability of nav link).
- **SC-002**: The initial visible set of events (first page / initial batch) renders within 2 seconds for typical end-user conditions (measured as median page load time during manual or synthetic tests).
- **SC-003**: Clicking an event navigates to the event detail page and opens within 2 seconds on the median of test runs.
- **SC-004**: 95% of users can find an event of interest (discoverability) within 15 seconds during usability testing (measured via simple task tests).
- **SC-005**: The feature must pass accessibility checks for common screen reader usage and keyboard-only navigation (no critical WCAG violations in basic checks).

## Assumptions

- There is an existing event detail page and routing pattern to link from an entry to the detail page.
- The nav bar already supports adding an item labeled "Events" and that label text is appropriate.
- Event data contains at minimum an id, title, and start date/time for published events.
- Performance targets above are reasonable defaults and can be tuned after initial implementation.

## Notes

- This specification focuses on WHAT the listing should provide and why; it intentionally avoids implementation details (no references to frameworks, APIs, or storage).
